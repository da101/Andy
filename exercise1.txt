Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is a technique that packages related data and methods into a single unit. To be more specific encapsulation is the process or methodology of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods.
Example:

public class Person{

   private String name;
   private String idNum;
   private int age;

   public int getAge(){
      return age;
   }

   public String getName(){
      return name;
   }

   public String getIdNum(){
      return idNum;
   }

   public void setAge( int newAge){
      age = newAge;
   }

   public void setName(String newName){
      name = newName;
   }

   public void setIdNum( String newId){
      idNum = newId;
   }
}


Inheritence :

Inheritance provided mechanism that allowed a class to inherit property of another class. When a Class extends another class it inherits all non-private members including fields and methods.

Example:

class Vehicle. 
{

}
class Car extends Vehicle 
{
 ..   //extends the property of vehicle class.
}


Polymorphism:

Polymorphism means more than one form, same object performing different operations according to the requirement. Polymorphism can be achieved by using two ways, those are Method overriding and Method overloading.

Example:

public abstract class Human{

   public abstract void goEat();
}

public class Male extends Human{

    @Override
    public void goEat(){
        System.out.println("Burger");
    }
}

public class Female extends Human{

    @Override
    public void goEat(){
        System.out.println("HotDog");
    }
}

Abstraction:

Abstraction is process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality. Abstraction in java is achieved by using interface and abstract class. Interface give 100% abstraction and abstract class give 0-100% abstraction.

Example:

abstract  class TwoWheeler {
    public abstract void run();
}
class Honda extends TwoWheeler{
	public void run(){
		System.out.println("Running..");
	}
}
public class Main{
	public static void main(String args[]){
        TwoWheeler test = new Honda();
        test.run();
    }
}
